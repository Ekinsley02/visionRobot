// Here is where I log all the time spent on my project and what I was doing!

// 05/14/2025 9:00 am - ?
// This is my first log! I am trying to create a structured codebase progression path so that I can
// come back another time and still understand whats happening.
// I want to start making the foundations, header files, baseline functions, constants and variables that will be used.
// By the end of the session today I will hopefully have a basic remote controller to calibrate the robot.
